              In this post I’m going to give a brief explanation of what serverless means, set out an example to help illustrate the practical difference between serverless and more traditional servers, highlight the benefits and pitfalls of choosing serverless, and then round up a few resources where you can continue your learning.

              The following week was the beginning of the JavaScript module. By this point my cohort and I had been learning for 10 weeks without a break and everyone was a bit run down. So, although what covered in week 11 wasn’t necessarily more difficult than things we’d learned before our brains were fragile and a few of us hit a bit of a wall.

              For the past four weeks I’ve been immersed in all things Java. Compared to Ruby, the language we focused on in our first module, Java is strict and fairly verbose. At first it seemed to require a lot of extra gumpf than Ruby to achieve basically the same result.

              On the evening of my second day at CodeClan I ended up at hospital at midnight because my eight month old daughter was having trouble breathing. She was fine, but we all got about three hours of sleep. The next few nights I stayed up hours later than I usually would reading around the topics we'd covered in class. That weekend I caught the flu.

              A year ago my day job involved listening to other people talk about all the reasons their current job was unsatisfying and why retraining as a software developer was the right move for them. For some people it was about job security, others wanted a job with more of a challenge, or more flexibility, or more money.
