      <article class="content">
      <p>After an intense android project week (which you can read about 
      over on the <a href="https://codeclan.com/blog/kates-project-diary-an-android-food-tracking-app/">
      CodeClan blog</a>), we had a week of Computer Science and job prep. 
      There are lots of terrifying things about swapping careers, but for me one 
      of the biggest ones was not knowing how to present myself both on paper and 
      in interviews in a way that was relevant a new industry so having someone 
      talk us through how to do this was incredibly helpful.</p>

    <p>The following week was the beginning of the JavaScript module. By this 
    point my cohort and I had been learning for 10 weeks without a break 
    and everyone was a bit run down. So although what covered in week 11 wasn’t 
    necessarily more difficult than things we’d learned before our brains were 
    fragile and a few of us hit a bit of a wall. For me this manifested as a guilt 
    spiral where I both felt like I couldn’t maintain the level of extra work and 
    reading I had been doing, and that I couldn’t slack off because I’d put my 
    family’s life on hold/ handed over the care of my baby to someone else in 
    order to do the course.</p>

    <p>The great thing about CodeClan is that your cohort become your support 
    system and so although we were all melting down, we did it together. Over the 
    course of a couple of weeks made sure to pull each other up: teas were made, 
    hugs were given. By the time project week rolled around most of us were back 
    from the brink.</p>

    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>I’d actually had a stab at learning JavaScript a couple of years ago. 
    Although I certainly wasn’t writing it in the best way or understanding 
    everything that was happening having had some exposure was really helpful 
    when it came to some of the more tricky concepts.</p>

    <p>I’ve loved the JavaScript module. Java was fine but a bit too verbose and 
    (dare I say) boring. JavaScript feels mildly anarchic, which I dig, but it’s 
    not just the flexibility that interests me. I find the whole ecosystem 
    surrounding JavaScript really fascinating, and learning about various tools 
    and frameworks is as interesting as the language itself.</p>

    <p>If you’ll indulge the humanities student in me, another thing about JavaScript 
    that really interests me is it’s place in web culture. Or rather, its place 
    transmitting, displaying, and generally corralling web culture (or I guess 
    just, culture). As the language that powers what can be achieved in the browser 
    it’s specs define not just the what’s and how’s of syntax, but dictate who can 
    access content, to what extent various companies can get a stronghold on these 
    modes of communication, what parts of our shared culture should be preserved, 
    and what is allowed to disappear or break. If a certain bit of syntax was 
    declared defunct, and browsers responded by removing their support 
    for that syntax, swathes of websites would break (depending on the specifics) and 
    we would lose access to pieces of our shared culture.</p>

    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>Throughout the JavaScript module I got a little obsessed with deploying my 
    homeworks on <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>. I took a task where we were supposed 
    to practice API calls and made it into a <a href="https://pokemon-top-trumps.glitch.me/">pokemon top trumps game</a>, and during a 
    lab a classmate and I put together an <a href="https://etch-a-sketch.glitch.me/">etch-a-sketch.</a></p>

    <p>We rounded off this module with a group project. It was a very different 
    experience to the projects that had come before and in the end was more about 
    learning how to work in a team of developers than it was about build something 
    shiny. My team and I put together a travel dashboard which aimed to help users 
    plan trips. We alternated between mob programming, where the four of us sat 
    around one machine and developed as a group, and paring. I was pretty proud with 
    what our group produced, but even more so with how we conducted ourselves and 
    how easily we worked together.</p>
